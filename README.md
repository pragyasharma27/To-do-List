## TO-DO-LIST

Itâ€™s a `list of tasks` you need to complete, or things that you want to do. 

One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you `stay organised`. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more `manageable`.

In this project, you can add the task according to your preference and after completing you have the option to `delete` the previous task.
